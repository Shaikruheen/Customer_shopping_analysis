# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, from loading and preparing data to generating business insights.
It covers Python-based EDA, SQL analysis, Power BI dashboards, and a final report & presentation created using Gamma.

The goal is to showcase the ability to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.

## 📁 Dataset

Name: Customer_Shopping_Behavior

Format: CSV

Description: Contains customer purchase information such as demographics, product category, price, quantity, invoice details, and transaction patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI

Gamma (for PPT creation)

GitHub (version control & documentation)

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Converted data types

Created new derived columns

Exported cleaned dataset for SQL & Power BI

## 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed analysis using Python to understand:
